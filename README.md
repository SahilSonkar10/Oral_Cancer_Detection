Oral cancer is a major global health issue accounting for 177,384 deaths in 2018 and
it is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. Enabling automation in the
identification of potentially malignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity would
potentially lead to low-cost and early diagnosis of the disease. Building a large library
of well-annotated oral lesions is key. In this paper we developed neural networks based
oral cancer detection using different image processing techniques. For that we are using
Convolutional Neural Network for the automated detection of oral lesions for the early
detection of oral cancer. Here we define oral cancer as malignant neoplasms of lip, tongue
and mouth.
Key Words: Oral Cancer, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, CNN, Benign, Malignant.
